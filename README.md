Node-React Sample App

I was looking for Node+React boilerplate, but I wasn't able to find proper one.
So I decided to create one by myself and have built this MERN boilerplate.
For the front-end, I've used create-react-app's ejected code.

To run this one, you need to do 
npm install

For development, you need to 
npm run start-server
npm run start-client

if you want the server to restart as server side code changes, you can run the server with
npm run start-server-watch


For Deployment,
you need to run
npm run build
npm run build-server
and then
npm start

It will run the production server.
